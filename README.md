# Polyamory Spice Rack

This is a simple spice rack with a polyamory logo giving structural support.

# How to use

Buy a wooden bar and cut it to the desired length. Measure width and height of the bar in mm and change the values of `front_bar_width` and `front_bar_height` accordingly. 5x5 mm works good, but use whatever is available.

For the base of the rack you need a flat piece of wood, cut to the same length. Measure the width and height of the base in mm and change the values of `base_width` and `base_height` accordingly.

# Issues

The polyamory logo is not adjusting automically to design changes. For now, you need to tweak it's parameters manually. Look especially at the `translate` and `scale` parameters on the y and z axis.
